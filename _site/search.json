Lets isolate the high and low points of the graph alone.\n\nufo_sightings_new%&gt;%\n  count(date_documented, name = \"count\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(date_documented = mdy(date_documented)) %&gt;%\n  gf_point(count ~ date_documented,\n           color = \"red\", size = 1.5) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Reported UFO Sightings per Date\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Sightings\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tells us that the data with lesser number of sightings is significantly more than data with higher number of sightings which makes intuitive sense. Lets make this more useful by making a gradient within the graph. Lowest - blue and highest - red\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\nufo_sightings_new %&gt;%\n  count(date_documented, name = \"count\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(date_documented = mdy(date_documented)) %&gt;%\n  gf_point(count ~ date_documented, color = ~count, size = 1.5) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\")) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Reported UFO Sightings per Date\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Sightings\",\n    color = \"Sightings Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising the graph with red points and the line graph:\n\nufo_sightings_new %&gt;%\n  mutate(date_documented = mdy(date_documented)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date_documented) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%\n  gf_line(count ~ date_documented) %&gt;%\n  gf_point(color = \"red\", size = 1) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Reported UFO Sightings Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Sightings\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph looks very congested so faceting it would give more precise graphs. Lets facet it into 8 different segments.\n\nufo_sightings_new %&gt;%\n  mutate(date_documented = mdy(date_documented),\n         segment = ntile(date_documented, 8)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date_documented, segment) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  gf_line(count ~ date_documented) %&gt;%\n  gf_point(color = \"red\", size = 1) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_wrap(~segment, scales = \"free_x\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Reported UFO Sightings Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Sightings\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be nice to see the highest and lowest point throughout the years.

Reported UFO Sightings by Day\nIt would be interesting to check whether UFO sightings are more common on certain days of the week. A bar graph can help visualize this.\n\nufo_sightings_new %&gt;%\n  count(weekday = wday(mdy_hm(date_time), label = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  gf_col(n ~ weekday, fill = \"orange\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Reported UFO Sightings by Day\", x = \"Day\", y = \"No of Reported Sightings\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday has the most number of UFO sightings reported but it isn’t exorbitantly high - but lets see a numeric representation for better understanding\n\nufo_sightings_byweek &lt;- ufo_sightings_new1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(weekday = wday(mdy_hm(date_time), label = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  count(weekday) %&gt;%\n  arrange(match(weekday, c(\"Sun\", \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\")))\n\nufo_sightings_byweek\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  weekday     n\n  &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 Sun      9625\n2 Mon      8340\n3 Tue      8954\n4 Wed      9130\n5 Thu      9162\n6 Fri      9641\n7 Sat     11664\n\n\n\n\n5. Reported UFO Sightings by Hours\nLets try doing the same but instead of days of week - we will try hours of week\n\nufo_sightings_new %&gt;%\n  count(hour = hour(mdy_hm(date_time))) %&gt;%\n  gf_col(n ~ hour, fill = \"skyblue\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Reported UFO Sightings by Hour\", x = \"Hour\", y = \"No of Reported Sightings\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. UFO Sightings by US States\nSince US is the biggest factor in ufo sightings - lets take each of US state and view its counts\n\nus_sightings &lt;- ufo_sightings_new1 %&gt;%\n  filter(country == \"us\") %&gt;%\n  count(state, sort = TRUE)\nglimpse(us_sightings)\n\nRows: 52\nColumns: 2\n$ state &lt;chr&gt; \"ca\", \"fl\", \"wa\", \"tx\", \"ny\", \"il\", \"az\", \"pa\", \"oh\", \"mi\", \"nc\"…\n$ n     &lt;int&gt; 8683, 3754, 3707, 3398, 2915, 2447, 2362, 2319, 2251, 1781, 1722…\n\n\nVisualising this into bar graphs\n\nus_sightings %&gt;%\n  gf_col(n ~ state, fill = ~state) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"UFO Sightings by US State\",\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"No of Reported Sightings\",\n    fill = \"State\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe states since they aren’t abreviated are very congested but the state coded California has a exorbidantly high number of reportings - lets find its value\n\nus_sightings %&gt;%\n  filter(state == \"ca\") %&gt;%\n  select(state, n)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  state     n\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 ca     8683\n\n\nCalifornia has 8683 ufo sightings which we can see is pretty high compared to the rest of the states but lets find the mean, median and mode to get an accurate understanding\n\nx &lt;- us_sightings$n\n\nsummary_table &lt;- tibble(\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\"),\n  Value = c(mean(x), median(x), as.numeric(names(sort(table(x), decreasing = TRUE)[1])))\n)\n\nsummary_table\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Statistic Value\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Mean      1222.\n2 Median     798 \n3 Mode         7 \n\n\nThe UFO sightings in CA is extremely high compared to all three mean, median and mode. So we can assume there is high delusion and hallucination rates in the state of California of the US."
