### Our Goal

To analyze patterns in police shootings in the US, including demographic, situational and geographic factors.

Our analyses might explore:

-   Variation by **race**, **gender**, **age**
-   Whether victims were **armed**
-   The role of **mental health** indicators
-   The effect of **fleeing** behavior and perceived **threat levels**
-   **Geographic** & **state**‐level patterns
-   **Yearly** and **monthly** trends

```{r}
police_shootings <- police_shootings_tbl_df
glimpse(police_shootings)
janitor::clean_names(police_shootings)
```

## Checking for Missing Values

```{r}
visdat::vis_dat(police_shootings)
```

**There are many missing entries; hence dropping the NA's**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 <- police_shootings %>% 
  naniar::replace_with_na_all(condition = ~ .x %in% common_na_strings) %>%
  naniar::replace_with_na_all(condition = ~ .x %in% common_na_numbers) %>% 
drop_na()
police_shootings_mod1
```

## Data Munging

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%  
mutate(
    manner_of_death = as_factor(manner_of_death),
    armed = as_factor(armed),
    gender = as_factor(gender),
    race = as_factor(race),
    city = as_factor(city),
    state = as_factor(state),
    signs_of_mental_illness = as_factor(signs_of_mental_illness),
    threat_level = as_factor(threat_level),
    flee = as_factor(flee),
    body_camera = as_factor(body_camera)
 )
```

## Examining the Data

### Counting the Race, Gender and Age

```{r}
# Race
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(race) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  tt()

# Gender
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(gender) %>%
  tt()

# Age
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(age) %>%
  tt()
```

### **Visualizing Race distribution**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(race), fill = "skyblue") %>%
  gf_labs(
     x = "Race",
    y = "Number of victims",
    title = "Race distribution of victims")

```

#### Observation

-   **White** individuals represent the majority (about half) of police shooting victims

-   **Black** individuals are the second largest group (about 1/4th), approximately half the frequency of White victims, followed by **Hispanics**

-   **Asian**, **Native**, and **Other** racial groups collectively represent only 4% of total incidents

#### **Inference**

-   The data suggests potential **racial disparities** in police shooting incidents

-   The **2:1 ratio** between White and Black victims may indicate either population distribution patterns or systemic factors

-   When adjusted for population demographics, Black individuals may experience higher per-capita rates of police shootings

### **Visualizing Gender distribution**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~ gender, fill = "steelblue") %>%
  gf_labs(
     x = "Gender",
    y = "Number of victims",
    title = "Gender distribution of victims")

```

#### Observation

-   The gender disparity is extreme, with males being **about** **20 time more** to be involved in police shootings than females

#### **Inference**

Males are disproportionately involved in situations that are critical and need the use of deadly force, potentially due to:

-   Higher rates of violent crime commission

-   Different patterns of resistance or confrontation with law enforcement

-   Occupational exposure (certain professions with police interaction)

### **Visualizing Age distribution**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
  count(age) %>% 
gf_line(n ~ age, colour = "navyblue") %>%
  gf_labs(
     x = "Age",
    y = "Number of victims",
    title = "Age distribution of victims") %>% 
  gf_refine(
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5)) 
  )

```

### **Observation**

-   There is a strongconcentrationofage between **20-40 years old,** with peak incidence at **ages 25-35**

-   There is a sharpincrease from teenage years, peaking in mid-to-late 20s, then a gradual **decline after age 35**

-   **Elderly victims** are rare but present, with incidents documented **up to age 91**

### **Inference**

-   The peak in late 20s and 30s aligns with ages of highest criminal offense rates and police encounters

-   This suggests that most incidents occur during police responses to criminal activity

### Examining the Situational & Psychological Factors

```{r}
# Manner of Death
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(manner_of_death) %>%
  tt()

# Armed status
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(armed) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  tt()

# Flee Status
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(flee) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  tt()

# Threat Level
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(threat_level) %>%
  tt()

# Mental Health
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(signs_of_mental_illness) %>%
  tt()

# Body Camera
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  dplyr::count(body_camera) %>%
  tt()
```

#### Observation

-   **Manner of death**: Most victims are shot. Some had to be tasered, is there a specific reason (like weapon type, threat level or mental illness which led to the outcome?)

-   **Armed**: Most victims were armed with guns, which explains the critical situation leading to being shot. This is followed by knifes and then unarmed

-   **Flee**: The majority of victims were not fleeing when shot

-   **Threat level**: About 2/3 of victims were perceived as attacking when shot

-   **Signs of mental illness**: About 1/4th of the victims have the signs of mental illness

-   **Body camera**: More than 75% of the victims don't have body cameras.

### Summarizing Full Table

```{r}
summary(police_shootings_mod1)
```

### Observation

-   The data is logged from the year 2015 to 2021

-   The youngest victim is 6 years and goes up to the age of 91. Average age is 34 years

## Building Hypothesis

### Is there any association between Race and Gender?

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
    count(across(c("gender", "race"))) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(race), 
       fill = ~gender, 
       position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(
     x = "Race",
    y = "Number of vicyims",
    title = "Race distribution of victims by Gender")

```

### Observation

-   The proportion of females are distinctly less, hence there is not much association between the two

-   The data supports sociological patterns where males tend towards confrontational behaviors and are overrepresented in situations likely to escalate to lethal force

### What is the Age Distribution across different Races?

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
  gf_density(~age, color = ~race, fill = ~race, alpha = 0.2) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Age Distribution by Race",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Density"
  )%>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))
  )
```

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
    count(across(c("age", "race"))) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
gf_boxplot(age ~ race, fill = ~race, orientation = "x") %>%
  gf_labs(
    x = "Race",
    y = "Age",
    title = "Age distribution across Races"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   Black and Others are usually younger in age

-   White and Asian victims are more spread out and Whites have higher median age

-   Hispanics have 2 peaks in their age - around 25s and 40s

-   Blacks and Natives show a distinct peak at around 25 and 30 respectively

#### Inference

-   **Black & Natives**: Young adulthood is the highest danger period, likely linked to street policing and urban violence exposure

    **White & Asian Pattern**: Risk spreads across all adult ages, suggesting more varied incidents like mental health crises, domestic disputes, and elderly situations

    **Hispanics**: Two different risk groups are seen in younger and older people

### What is the association between different situational factors

```{r}
# Race vs. Manner of Death
vcd::structable(race ~ manner_of_death, data = police_shootings_mod1) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  addmargins() %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "Race")

vcd::structable(race ~ manner_of_death, data = police_shootings_mod1) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Race vs. Manner of Death",
              gp = shading_max)

# Gender vs. Manner of Death
vcd::structable(gender ~ manner_of_death, data = police_shootings_mod1) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  addmargins() %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "Gender")

vcd::structable(gender ~ manner_of_death, data = police_shootings_mod1) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Gender vs. Manner of Death",
              gp = shading_max)

# Manner of Death vs. Weapon type
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(armed_top5 = fct_lump_n(armed, 5)) %>%
  vcd::structable(manner_of_death ~ armed_top5, data = .) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  addmargins() %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "Manner of Death")

police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(armed_top5 = fct_lump_n(armed, 5)) %>%
  vcd::structable(manner_of_death ~ armed_top5, data = .) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Manner of Death vs. Top 5 Weapon Types",
              gp = shading_max)

# Manner of Death vs. Threat level
vcd::structable(manner_of_death ~ threat_level, data = police_shootings_mod1) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Manner of Death vs. Threat Level",
              gp = shading_max)

# Manner of Death vs. Mental Illness
vcd::structable(manner_of_death ~ signs_of_mental_illness, data = police_shootings_mod1) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Manner of Death vs. Mental Illness Signs",
              gp = shading_max)
```

### **Observation**

-   Race and Gender don't have any distinct association with the manner of death

-   Victims having gun and those perceived as threatening, show a distinct negative correlation with being shot and tasered meaning some distance had to be maintained

-   Those who are armed with knife, show positive correlation being shot and tasered

-   Victims showing signs of mental illness shows have a positive correlation with being shot and tasered

### Inference

-   Weapon type and mental state determine police tactics. Guns trigger immediate lethal response, while other weapons/conditions allow for attempted intermediate options.

### **Are there any yearly or monthly trends in the shootings?**

```{r}
police_shootings_dates <- police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(format(date, "%Y")),
    month = as.numeric(format(date, "%m"))
  )
```


```{r}
# Yearly trend
police_shootings_dates %>%
  count(year) %>%
  gf_line(n ~ year, color = "steelblue", size = 1) %>%
  gf_point(color = "steelblue", size = 2) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Yearly Trend in Police Shootings",
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Number of Shootings"
  ) %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(police_shootings_dates$year))
  )
```

```{r}
# Monthly trend
police_shootings_dates %>%
     mutate(
    month = format(as.Date(date), "%b"),
    month = factor(month, levels = month.abb)
  ) %>%
  count(month) %>%
  gf_line(n ~ month, group = 1, color = "dodgerblue", size = 1) %>%
  gf_point(color = "dodgerblue", size = 2) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Monthly Trend in Police Shootings",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Number of Shootings"
  ) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date, "%Y"))) %>%
  count(year, race) %>%
  gf_line(n ~ year, color = ~race) %>%
  gf_point(n ~ year, color = ~race) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Yearly Shooting Trends by Race")
```

### **Observation**

-   ksjeh

-   ksejrh

-   ksj

### **Inference**

-   sldfkj

-   sldkfj

-   sjdfh

### **How does Age influence other factors?**

**Association of age with fleeing and weapon type**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(
    flee = fct_infreq(flee),      
    armed = fct_lump_n(armed, 5)
  ) %>%
  gf_boxplot(age ~ flee,
             fill = ~armed,
             orientation = "x" ) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Age Distribution by Flee type and Weapon status",
    x = "Flee Type",
    y = "Age of Victim",
    fill = "Weapon Type"
  )
```

**Age distribution by Flee status**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  gf_density(~age, color = ~flee, fill = ~flee, alpha = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Age Distribution by Flee Status") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1"),
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))
  )
```

### Observation

-   Those **“Not fleeing”** or fleeing by **car** appear slightly older on average than those fleeing **on foot**.

-   Median ages for “Not fleeing” and “Car” are higher, while “Foot” and “Other” categories have lower medians.

-   **Guns** and **knives** dominate across all flee types.

-   **Unarmed** individuals appear in every flee category, often with similar or slightly lower median ages compared to armed groups.

-   The **variation** is generally higher for armed individuals, indicating broader age diversity among armed victims.

-   A few older individuals (60+) appear across all flee types, particularly in the **“Not fleeing”** group.

### Inference

-   There is **no strong age-flee interaction**, but the slightly higher median ages among “Not fleeing” cases could indicate that older victims are **less likely to attempt escape**.

-   The consistent presence of **unarmed victims** across flee types highlights that **weapon possession is not always tied to fleeing behavior**.

-   The broad age spread, especially in “Not fleeing” cases, suggests **police encounters affect a wide demographic**, not limited to younger populations.

#### **Age distribution over the years for different Races**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date, "%Y"))) %>%
  gf_point(age ~ year, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_lm(age ~ year) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap(~ race) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Age Distribution Over Years by Race",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Age"
  )
```

### Observation

-   Across all racial groups , most victims fall in the **25–45 age range**, with only slight variations.

-   The median age remains relatively stable over time (2015–2020) with no significant increase or decrease in any group.

-   **White** and **Black** individuals have the **highest representation** and wider spread in age distribution.

-   Other races (Asian, Native, Hispanic, etc.) show **smaller sample sizes** and thus more variability.

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  count(city, state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(15) %>%  # Top 15 locations
  unite(location, city, state, sep = ", ") %>%
  select(location) %>%
  inner_join(police_shootings_mod1 %>% 
              unite(location, city, state, sep = ", "), 
            by = "location") %>%
  gf_boxplot(age ~ fct_reorder(location, age), fill = "forestgreen", orientation = "x") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Age Distribution by Location (Top 15 Cities)",
    x = "City, State",
    y = "Age"
  ) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### Observation

-   Some cities like **Chicago, Columbus, and St. Louis** have younger victims, while **Miami and Las Vegas** show slightly higher medians.

-   The **spread** varies, larger in cities like Los Angeles and Jacksonville, suggesting more diverse victim age groups there.

### How does location of a State and city determine the shootings?

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  count(city, state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(30) %>%  # Taking top 30 locations
  unite(location, city, state, sep = ", ") %>%
  gf_point(n ~ fct_reorder(location, n), size = ~n, color = "red") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Police Shootings by Location",
    x = "City, State",
    y = "Number of Shootings"
  ) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### Observation

-   **Los Angeles, CA** reports the **highest number of police shootings**, followed by **Phoenix, AZ**, **Houston, TX**, and **Las Vegas, NV**.

-   The distribution is **right-skewed** where a few major cities account for a **disproportionately large share** of total shootings.

-   Many smaller or mid-size cities (e.g., Colorado Springs, Charlotte) have fewer than 20 recorded incidents.

### Inference

-   Police shootings predominantly involve **young to middle-aged individuals (25–40 years old)** across most races and cities, with no major age trend changes over time. However, **incidents are geographically concentrated**, a small number of large urban centers (like Los Angeles and Phoenix) account for the **bulk of cases**, indicating regional disparities that may be tied to **population density, policing intensity, or systemic factors**.

### How does perceived threat level influence the shootings

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  count(city, state, threat_level) %>%
  group_by(city, state) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
  filter(total >= 10) %>%  # Cities with 10+ incidents
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(50) %>%
  unite(location, city, state, sep = ", ") %>%
  gf_col(n ~ location, fill = ~threat_level, position = "fill") %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Threat Level Distribution by City")
```

### Observation

-   Across most cities, the **attack threat level dominates**, with smaller proportions of other and undetermined cases.

-   Cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Antonio show particularly high instances of attack classified incidents, while places like Columbus and Jacksonville have slightly higher variation across categories.

### Inference

-   This suggests that police encounters in many **urban centers** are predominantly categorized as threats requiring lethal or aggressive response levels.

-   The consistency across locations might indicate **uniform policy interpretation** rather than contextual variations in local threat assessment.

### **Influence of Weapons on different factors**

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(weapon_cat = fct_lump_n(armed, 6)) %>%
  count(race, weapon_cat) %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  gf_tile(prop ~ race + weapon_cat) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Weapon Type Distribution by Race",
    x = "Race",
    y = "Weapon Type",
    fill = "Proportion"
  )
```

### Observation

-   The heatmap shows that guns are the most common weapon type across all racial groups, particularly pronounced among Black and White victims.

-   Non-firearm weapons (like knives and toy weapons) appear far less frequently, with a few variations among racial groups.

### Inference

-   This pattern could indicate both a systemic emphasis on firearm-related encounters and possible disparities in perceived weapon possession across racial groups.

-   The high prevalence of gun-related cases may also reflect broader accessibility and cultural factors related to weapon ownership.

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(weapon_cat = fct_lump_n(armed, 5)) %>%
  count(weapon_cat, threat_level) %>%
  gf_col(n ~ weapon_cat, fill = ~threat_level, position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Weapon Type vs Threat Level",
    x = "Weapon Type",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Threat Level"
  ) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Observation

-   Individuals categorized as notfleeing form the largest proportion across all weapon types, especially for guns, knives, and unarmed cases.

-   Vehicle-related cases show relatively more instances of fleeing by car, while foot fleeing is modestly present across some categories.

### Influence

-   This could suggest that most encounters leading to recorded incidents occur when suspects are stationary or restrained rather than actively escaping. However, the relatively higher “car fleeing” in vehicle-related incidents might point to situational factors influencing pursuit and response dynamics.

```{r}
police_shootings_mod1 %>%
  mutate(weapon_cat = fct_lump_n(armed, 8)) %>%
  count(weapon_cat, flee) %>%
  group_by(weapon_cat) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  gf_col(prop ~ weapon_cat, fill = ~flee, position = "fill") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Flee Behavior by Weapon Type",
    subtitle = "Proportion of flee status for each weapon category",
    x = "Weapon Type",
    y = "Proportion",
    fill = "Flee Status"
  ) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Observation

-   Gun-related incidents overwhelmingly fall under the attack threat level, followed by knives and unarmed cases at much lower frequencies.

-   Toy weapons and vehicles have very few attack classifications, and undetermined cases remain minimal overall.

### Inference

-   Weapons perceived as more dangerous (like firearms) are strongly associated with escalated threat responses. This pattern could imply that the presence of a gun, regardless of situation, significantly biases threat assessment, leading to higher rates of lethal force justification.

## Conclusion

-   **Demographic Trends:** Majority of victims are **male (25–40 years)**; **Black individuals** face disproportionately higher risk relative to population size.

-   **Situational Insights:** Most victims were **armed**, often with **guns**, but a notable share were **unarmed or mentally ill**, raising questions about threat assessment and escalation.

-   **Behavioral Patterns:** Many were **not fleeing**, showing that fatal shootings often occur in static encounters, not active chases.

-   **Threat Perception:** “**Attack**” is the most frequent threat label, especially when firearms are involved — suggesting strong bias toward perceiving high threat.

-   **Geographic Trends:** Incidents cluster in **urban hubs** like Los Angeles, Houston, and Phoenix, showing concentration in large metro areas.

    The data suggests that **systemic patterns**, not isolated incidents, underlie police shootings in the U.S. While armed confrontations explain part of the trend, **biases in threat perception, inadequate handling of mental health crises, and regional concentration of incidents** all point to the need for deeper structural reform.
