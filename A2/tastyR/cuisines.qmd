    max_cook_time = mean(cook_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_total_time = mean(total_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_servings = mean(servings, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(max_total_time)) %>% 
  datatable(cuisines_factor)
```

-   Here we see that for certain dishes, **the prep time, cook time & total time is 0** - which is inaccurate.
-   The **prep_time + cook_time doesn't add up to the total_time** as mentioned in the data dictionary.

### **Filtering out 0 values in Prep, Cook & Total Time:**

```{r}
cuisines_clean <- cuisines_factor %>%
  filter(prep_time > 0, cook_time > 0, total_time > 0)
cuisines_clean %>% arrange(desc(total_time)) %>% select(name, country, prep_time,cook_time, total_time) %>% 
  datatable(cuisines_clean)
```

```{r}
cuisine_correct_time <- cuisines_clean %>%
  mutate(sum_time = prep_time + cook_time)
cuisine_correct_time %>% 
  select(name, country, prep_time,cook_time, total_time, sum_time) %>% 
  datatable(cuisine_correct_time)
```

```{r}
cuisine_correct_time %>% filter(total_time!=sum_time) %>% 
  select(name, country, prep_time,cook_time, total_time, sum_time) %>% 
  datatable(cuisine_correct_time)
```

From the data dictionary, cook_time does not account for fermentation, marination, waiting periods which is done in dishes like breads, chicken etc.

-   **prep_time = before heat (chopping, mixing)**
-   **cook_time = with heat (boil, bake, fry etc)**
-   **total_time = prep + cook (but not fermentation/marination)**

We also observed that the **total_time values do not match the sum of prep_time and cook_time, even when excluding processes like fermentation or marination.** This shows inconsistencies in the dataset due to missing or incorrectly recorded values from the original sources.

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(avg_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_reviews = sum(reviews, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_rating)) %>% 
  datatable(cuisines_factor)
```

```{r}

## Case Study: Italian Food

After viewing the carbs, protein, fat content by countries- it is seen that Italian food have higher average nutrient content than other countries.

#### 1. Calories Comparison

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>%
  mutate(is_italian = ifelse(country == "Italian","Italian", "Other")) %>%
  gf_boxplot(calories ~ is_italian, fill = c("paleturquoise3", "paleturquoise4"), orientation = "x") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Calories: Italian vs. Other Cuisines",
    x = "Cuisine Category",
    y = "Calories"
  )
```

#### 2. Protein Comparison

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>%
  mutate(is_italian = ifelse(country == "Italian","Italian", "Other")) %>%
  gf_boxplot(protein ~ is_italian, fill = c("palegreen3", "palegreen4"), orientation = "x") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Protein: Italian vs. Other Cuisines",
    x = "Cuisine Category",
    y = "Protein"
  )
```

#### 3. Fat Comparison

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>%
  mutate(is_italian = ifelse(country == "Italian","Italian", "Other")) %>%
  gf_boxplot(fat ~ is_italian, fill = c("royalblue", "royalblue4"), orientation = "x") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Fat Content: Italian vs. Other Cuisines",
    x = "Cuisine Category",
    y = "Fat"
  )
```

**We seen there's an higher median for Italian food nutrients - does having higher calories, fat and protein make it unhealthy?**

Italian cooking is deeply rooted in the Mediterranean diet, which is widely recognized by nutritionists and health experts for its numerous benefits. A common *misconception is having high number of calories, protein and fats - makes food unhealthy*. However, not all high-calorie or high-fat foods are unhealthy. Italian diet uses whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and olive oil as the primary sources of fat. Therefore, many traditional Italian dishes naturally incorporate these healthy elements.

-   **Olive Oil**: Rich in monounsaturated fats, known for their heart-healthy properties. Tomatoes: Packed with antioxidants like lycopene.
-   **Garlic and Onions**: Offer various health benefits and add flavor without excessive calories.

## Correlation between Variables

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(
  cuisines_factor %>% drop_na(),
  columns = c(
    "fat", "calories", "protein", "servings"
  ),
  switch = "both",
  progress = FALSE,

  diag = list(continuous = "barDiag"),
  lower = list(continuous = wrap("smooth", alpha = 0.3, se = FALSE)),

  title = "Cuisine Data Correlations Plot"
)
```

-   Fat & Protein have a high +ve correlation.
-   Calories & Fat have a high +ve correlation which shows that fat is a major contributor to calories.
-   Calories & Protein have a high +ve correlation which shows that protein is a major contributor to calories.
-   Number of servings, calories, fat and protein have a very low correlation.

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(
  cuisine_correct_time %>% drop_na(),
  columns = c(
    "servings", "sum_time", "cook_time", "prep_time", "total_ratings","reviews","avg_rating"
  ),
  switch = "both",
  progress = FALSE,

  diag = list(continuous = "barDiag"),
  lower = list(continuous = wrap("smooth", alpha = 0.3, se = FALSE)),

  title = "Cuisine Data Correlations Plot"
)
```

-   From the above plot, it is seen that Reviews and Total Rating have a high +ve correlation.Which means the number of Reviews is an important factor for a recipe to get a high rating.

#### Hypothesis: Dishes that have more number of servings will have more total time.

```{r}
cuisine_correct_time %>%
  gf_point(sum_time ~ servings, alpha = 0.5, color = "darkblue") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Total Time vs. Number of Servings",
    x = "Servings",
    y = "Total Time"
  ) %>%
  gf_lm(color="black")
```

-   The trend is not that significant - not a strong correlation between the 2 variables.

#### Hypothesis: The more number of reviews, the higher the rating

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>%
  gf_point(reviews~total_ratings, alpha = 0.5, color = "darkviolet") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Total Ratings vs. Reviews",
    x = "Total Reviews",
    y = "Total Ratings"
  ) %>%
  gf_lm(color = "black")
```

The scatterplot shows a high +ve relation - which proves the hypothesis that total reviews and total ratings are +vely correlated.

#### Hypothesis: Food with more calories have higher ratings

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>% 
  gf_point(total_ratings~calories, alpha = 0.5, color = "seagreen") %>% 
  gf_lm(color = "black") %>% 
  gf_labs(title ="Calories vs Total Ratings",
          x = "Calories",
          y ="Total Ratings")
```

The scatterplot shows that Calories and Total Ratings have no correlation - which disproves the hypothesis.

#### Hypothesis: Recipes with a longer preparation time will have fewer total reviews since preparation is not that easy

```{r}
cuisine_correct_time %>% 
  gf_point(sum_time~total_ratings, alpha = 0.5, color = "royalblue") %>% 
  gf_labs(title="Time vs Reviews",
          x = "Total Time",
          y = "Total Ratings") %>% 
  gf_lm(color = "black")
```

Here it is seen that, the *r value is -0.02 which is a very low relation*. Therefore, having a longer or shorter preparation time is not a strong determining factor in how many people review a recipe.

```{r}
cuisines_factor %>%
  gf_point(calories ~ servings, alpha = 0.5, color = "darkred") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Calories vs. Servings",
    x = "Servings",
    y = "Calories"
  ) %>%
  gf_lm(color = "black")
```

```{r}
mosaic::cor_test(calories ~ servings, data = cuisines_factor) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Total Time vs Total Ratings"
  )
```

-   The correlation between Calories and Servings is present but is weak (r= -0.32)

## Total Time vs Country

```{r}
top_5_countries_time<- cuisine_correct_time %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_tt= mean(sum_time, na.rm = TRUE),
  )
top_5_countries_time %>% arrange(desc(avg_tt)) %>% 
  datatable(top_5_countries_time)
```

```{r}
top_5_countries_time<- cuisine_correct_time %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_tt= mean(sum_time, na.rm = TRUE),
  ) %>%
   slice_max(n=35, order_by = avg_tt)
top_5_countries_time %>% 
  gf_col(reorder(country, avg_tt)~avg_tt, fill = "seagreen")%>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Top Countries by Average Time",
    x = "Average Time",
    y = "Country"
  )
```

#### Observations:

1.  **Highest Total Time**

## Dish Rating

```{r}
top_10_dishes_rating <- cuisines_factor %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(
    max_total_rating = max(total_ratings, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_reviews = max(reviews, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%

  arrange(desc(max_total_rating)) %>% 
  slice_head(n=20)


top_10_dishes_rating %>%
  gf_col(reorder(name, max_total_rating) ~ max_total_rating, fill = "indianred") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Top 20 Highest Rated Recipes",
    x = "Total Rating",
    y = "Dish Name"
  )
```

```{r}
top_10_dishes_rating %>% 
  gf_col(reorder(name, max_reviews) ~ max_reviews, fill = "indianred") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Top 20 Highest Reviewed Recipes",
    x = "Max Reviews",
    y = "Dish Name"
  )
```

As we saw in the previous correlation graph, Reviews and Rating have a high +ve correlation.

The top three recipes are the same in both charts:

-   **Cheesy Amish Breakfast Casserole**

-   **Blender Hollandaise Sauce**

-   **Boneless Buffalo Wings**

The similarity in the rankings implies that getting a **high amount of reviews** is a major factor of a **high total rating**. If a recipe is good, it gets a lot of reviews which increases the Total Rating. Whereas, a poor recipe wouldn't maintain both a high review volume or a high total rating.
